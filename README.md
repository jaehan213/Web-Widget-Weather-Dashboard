# Web-Widget-Weather-Dashboard
Weather Dashboard

The project was completed along the guidelines for UCLA Extension's Module 6 Challenge.

The application deploys a weather dashboard that allows the user to view the current and future weather conditions of a particular city. 

The dashboard contains a search history section for ease of access to weather conditions of past-searched cities, a jumbotron for the current weather conditions, and 5 mini-cards that display the future weather conditions for the next 5 days. 

The data was retrieved from the OpenWeather One Call API.
